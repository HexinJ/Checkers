# Checkers
I developed a digital checkers game from scratch using Java, complete with a user-friendly interface. The project consists of three key components:

- Game Logic and Board Tracking: I created abstract classes to manage the state of the board, keeping track of the positions of pieces and whether spaces are occupied or empty.
- User Interface and Interactions: I designed graphical classes to handle the visual aspects of the game, such as displaying the board, moving pieces, and detecting mouse clicks for player interactions.
- Rules and Gameplay Mechanics: The rules for legal moves, capturing pieces, and win conditions were implemented within the abstract board class to ensure the game adhered to the official rules of checkers.
- 
This project demonstrates my ability to combine logic, graphical design, and user interaction to create a functional and engaging application.
