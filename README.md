# Checkers
I used Java to create a digital checkers game with user interface from scratch. There are three components to this project: abstract classes, graphical classes, and rules. Abstract classes keep track of the locations of pieces on the board, and the status of spaces on the board (filled or not filled). Graphical classes keep track of the user interface, the movement of images, and mouse events. Rules are written in the abstract board class to determine legal moves, and win conditions.
